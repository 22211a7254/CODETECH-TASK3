Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Synthetic Dataset

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a synthetic dataset. EDA aims to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset, understand its structure, identify patterns, and uncover insights through visualization and statistical analysis.

Dataset
The synthetic dataset used in this project includes the following features:

Age: Integer values ranging from 18 to 70, representing the age of individuals.
Salary: Normally distributed continuous values with a mean of 50,000 and a standard deviation of 15,000, indicating the annual salary.
Experience: Integer values between 0 and 40, representing years of work experience.
Education_Level: Categorical variable with four possible levels: 'High School', 'Bachelor', 'Master', 'PhD'.
Purchased: Binary outcome (0 or 1), where 0 indicates no purchase and 1 indicates a purchase was made.
Steps Involved
Data Generation

A synthetic dataset is generated with 1,000 samples using random number generation techniques.
Various features are included to simulate real-world data.
Initial Data Examination

Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview.
Check basic information, such as data types and non-null counts.
Obtain summary statistics to understand distributions and central tendencies.
Missing Values Analysis

Identify any missing values in the dataset to assess data completeness.
Visualizing Data Distributions

Create histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical features (Age, Salary, Experience).
Exploring Relationships

Use a pairplot to explore relationships between numerical features and to identify potential correlations or patterns.
Correlation Analysis

Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix to understand how numerical features are interrelated.
Plot a heatmap to visually represent these correlations.
Outlier Detection

Use boxplots to identify potential outliers in numerical features. Outliers can indicate anomalies or special cases in the dataset.
Visualization Tools
Matplotlib: Used for plotting histograms and boxplots.
Seaborn: Used for creating pairplots, heatmaps, and more advanced visualizations.
Insights and Outcomes
The EDA process provides insights into:

Data Distribution: Understanding the spread and central tendency of features.
Feature Relationships: Identifying how features interact with one another.
Data Quality: Detecting missing values and outliers.
Correlations: Revealing the strength and direction of relationships between numerical features.
This overview encapsulates the purpose and methodology of the EDA project, providing a clear understanding of how to analyze and interpret the synthetic dataset.
